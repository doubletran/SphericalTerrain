A special thing about landscapes that they are self-similar at different scales. Fractals are similar in this nature. Thus,  they are often used in landscapes to make it realistic. 
In this project, I explored the generation of terrain on spherical surfaces based on geometrical modelling. The algorithm was proposed in the paper ![Generation and Rendering of Fractal Terrains on Approximated
 Spherical Surfaces](https://worldcomp-proceedings.com/proc/p2013/CGV4061.pdf). It combines two methods : (1) creating fractal terrain by midpoint displacement and (2) generating geodesic spherical approximations by polyheral subdivision
